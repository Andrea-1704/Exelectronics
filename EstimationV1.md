# Project Estimation - CURRENT

Version:

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZElectronics project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop
the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch

# Estimate by size

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons
for the difference
